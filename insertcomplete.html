      <h2>Welcome Planeswalkers!</h2>

    <h2>Why the Database?</h2>
    <p>Well, what exactly is a database and what does it do? Our database of Magic cards is what you would call a 'Relational Database' which, well, consists of many different relations. These relations are usually represented as tables. They contain columns of attributes and rows of values. A Database Management System is used to create and manage these databases. </p>
    <p>Right now, you're probably thinking, &quot;Why not just put all those cards in a list and sort through the list?&quot; We are using a database to avoid inconsistentsies. Changing a list may cause modification problems. We can solve these problems by splitting lists into several tables. </p>

    <p>Although the cable cars are now mainly a tourist attraction,  they&rsquo;re still used by local commuters to get to and from work. The California  Street line is particularly popular among commuters on weekdays.</p>

    <h2>Cable Car Tips</h2>
    <p>A single ride on a cable car costs $6. If you plan to travel  around the city, it&rsquo;s often cheaper to buy a <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfares/passports.htm">Muni Passport</a>, which gives you  unlimited rides on San Francisco&rsquo;s extensive public transport system, including  the cable cars (but not the <a href="http://www.bart.gov/">BART subway system</a>). Even a single-day passport  ($14) will save you money if you make a return trip, and stop off to visit  Chinatown one way.</p>
    <p>There are often long lines at the cable car terminus,  particularly on the Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde routes. If you don&rsquo;t want to  wait, try walking a few stops along the route. The conductor usually leaves a  small number of places to pick up passengers on the way. The California Street  route is generally less crowded (but not as spectacular).</p>
