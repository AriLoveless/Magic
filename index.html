    <h2>Why the Database?</h2>
    <p>Well, what exactly is a database and what does it do? Our database of Magic cards is what you would call a 'Relational Database' which, well, consists of many different relations. These relations are usually represented as tables. They contain columns of attributes and rows of values. A Database Management System is used to create and manage these databases. </p>
    <p>Right now, you're probably thinking, &quot;Why not just put all those cards in a list and sort through the list?&quot; We are using a database to avoid inconsistentsies. Changing a list may cause modification problems. We can solve these problems by splitting lists into several tables. </p>
